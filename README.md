# FFT and DSP Learning Journey

I am currently practicing and implementing DSP (Digital Signal Processing) concepts in Python using libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Check out the `dsp_scipy.ipynb` notebook for my implementations.

## Learning Path

The concepts I am trying to learn, starting from:

1. **Generating sine signals** - Creating basic waveforms and understanding signal generation
2. **Understanding FFT** - Fast Fourier Transform and frequency domain analysis
3. **Digital Signal Processing** - Getting a better grip on DSP fundamentals over a period of time
4. **Radio Frequency Signals** - Moving into RF signal processing
5. **Radar Concepts** - Possibly diving into radar signal processing

## Timeline

Starting my journey today (February 15, 2026). Let's see where I am in 3 months!
